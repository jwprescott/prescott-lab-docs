# Inflated Brain

The QIAS Inflated Brain software takes a Freesurfer-style cortical surface mesh with an overlay and creates a movie file showing the brain "inflating" (expanding the surface to remove sulcal and gyral topography) and "deflating" (retracting the surface to show normal gyral and sulcal topography). This is meant to be used in cases such as pre-surgical fMRI studies as an aid in surgical planning, demonstrating activations in a way that can be more natural to a surgeon, similar to viewing the brain's surface in the operating room.

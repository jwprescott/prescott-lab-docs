# Brain Atrophy

The QIAS Brain Atrophy software calculates volumes of brain structures from T1 MR images and creates a report with comparisons between an individual patient's anatomy and that of an age and sex-matched cohort of cognitively normal subjects. The comparisons can be used to assist in the evaluation of patients with cognitive impairment or dementia, particularly dementia of the Alzheimer type.

The software can be downloaded from: [https://github.com/jwprescott/qias\_release.git](https://github.com/jwprescott/qias_release.git)
